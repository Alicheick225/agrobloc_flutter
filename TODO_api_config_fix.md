# TODO: API Configuration Fix - Centralized URL Management

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Created ApiConfig class in api_token.dart with dev/prod environments
- [x] Updated authService.dart to use ApiConfig.apiBaseUrl
- [x] Updated annonceVenteService.dart to use ApiConfig.annoncesBaseUrl (port 8080)
- [x] Updated tyoeCultureService.dart to use ApiConfig.typesCulturesBaseUrl (port 8000)
- [x] Updated AnnoncePrefinancementService.dart to use ApiConfig.annoncesBaseUrl (port 8080)
- [x] Updated image.dart to use ApiConfig.imageBaseUrl
- [x] Updated commandeService.dart to use ApiConfig.apiBaseUrl
- [x] Updated parcelleService.dart to use ApiConfig.apiBaseUrl
- [x] Fixed TypeCultureService endpoint paths from underscore to hyphen (/api/types-cultures)
- [x] Refactored AnnonceAchatService to use ApiConfig instead of hardcoded URLs
- [x] Verified configuration works with flutter analyze (no compilation errors)

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks
- [x] Update remaining services with hardcoded URLs:
  - [x] avisService.dart
  - [x] commande_vente_service.dart
  - [x] AnnonceAchat.dart
  - [ ] Other services found in search results
- [x] Test API connections with new configuration (curl tests passed)
- [x] Verify backend server is running on configured URLs (confirmed by user)
- [ ] Add better error handling for network failures
- [ ] Update environment switching mechanism if needed

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration Details
- **Dev API Base URL**: http://192.168.252.199:3000
- **Dev Image Base URL**: http://192.168.252.199:8080
- **Current Environment**: Development (isProduction = false)
- **Config Location**: lib/core/utils/api_token.dart (ApiConfig class)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps
1. Verify backend server is running on 192.168.252.199:3000
2. Test authentication flow
3. Test image loading
4. Test various API endpoints
5. Switch to production environment when ready

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues
- Some services use different ports (8000 vs 3000) - may need separate config for different services
- Error: "ClientException: Failed to fetch" - likely due to backend server not running or network issues

## âœ… Verification Results
- Flutter analyze completed successfully with 413 issues (mostly style warnings, no compilation errors)
- ApiConfig class is properly recognized and imported
- All updated services compile without errors
- Centralized configuration is working as expected
