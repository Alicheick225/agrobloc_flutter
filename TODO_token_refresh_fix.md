# TODO: Fix Token Refresh Issue

## Problem
- refresh_token is empty ("") in SharedPreferences
- When access token expires, UserService tries to refresh but fails due to empty refresh_token
- This triggers forced relogin and circuit breaker opens
- backup_token exists but is not used for refresh

## Solution
1. Modify UserService.getValidToken() to use backup_token when refresh_token is empty
2. Improve refresh logic to handle missing refresh tokens
3. Add fallback mechanism for token refresh

## Tasks
- [x] Update UserService.getValidToken() to check backup_token when refresh_token is invalid
- [x] Modify refresh logic to use backup_token as refresh token if available
- [x] Code review and logic verification completed
- [x] Fix authentication cache issue after login (clear cache in setCurrentUser)
- [ ] Improve AuthService to better handle missing refresh tokens during login
- [ ] Add better error handling for token refresh failures
- [ ] Test the token refresh mechanism in production
