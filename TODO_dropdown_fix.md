# DropdownButton Assertion Error Fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the DropdownButton assertion error in AnnonceForm.dart
- [x] Identified cause: value not matching exactly one item due to async loading and potential duplicates
- [x] Modified _buildDropdown method to:
  - Remove duplicates from items list using Set
  - Check if value exists in items; if not, set to null
- [x] Added loading state to prevent building form before data is loaded
- [x] Fixed pre-filling of form fields when editing:
  - For cultures: Match ignoring case to handle data inconsistencies, corrected type comparison
  - For parcelles: Match by adresse to set the correct libelle
- [x] Applied changes to lib/core/features/Agrobloc/presentations/widgets/producteurs/homes/AnnonceForm.dart

## Summary
The fix ensures that the DropdownButton's value is always null or matches exactly one item in the items list, preventing the assertion error. The loading state ensures the form is not built until the dropdown data is loaded, avoiding the error during initial load or editing. Additionally, the form now correctly pre-fills the fields when editing an existing annonce, matching the data appropriately.
