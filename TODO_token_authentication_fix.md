# TODO: Token Authentication Fix

## Issue Fixed
The "Utilisateur non connecté ou token manquant" error was occurring in the prefinancement form when checking user authentication.

## Root Cause
The `userService.isLoggedIn` property was being checked without first loading user data from SharedPreferences. This property checks instance variables (`_currentUser` and `_token`) which are null if `loadUser()` hasn't been called yet.

## Solution Implemented
- Replaced `userService.isLoggedIn` check with `await userService.isUserAuthenticated()` in `prefinancementForm.dart`
- `isUserAuthenticated()` properly loads user data from SharedPreferences before checking authentication status
- Added proper async handling and error management

## Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/core/features/Agrobloc/presentations/widgets/producteurs/homes/prefinancementForm.dart`
  - Updated `_envoyerDemande()` method to use proper authentication check
  - Added comment explaining the authentication verification

## Testing Instructions
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to the prefinancement form
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. **Expected Result**: No "Utilisateur non connecté ou token manquant" error should occur

## Verification
- [x] Authentication check now loads user data before verification
- [x] Error handling remains consistent
- [x] No other files use `isLoggedIn` incorrectly

## Status
- [x] Issue identified and analyzed
- [x] Root cause determined
- [x] Fix implemented
- [x] Code changes applied successfully
- [ ] Testing completed (pending user verification)
