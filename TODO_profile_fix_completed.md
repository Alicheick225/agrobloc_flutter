# Profile Fix Implementation Completed

## Issue Resolved
The problem where buyer profiles showed "Profil non défini" has been fixed.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserService Enhancement
**File:** `lib/core/features/Agrobloc/data/dataSources/userService.dart`
- Added validation check in `setCurrentUser()` method to detect empty `profilId`
- Added logging to warn when `profilId` is empty for debugging purposes

### 2. Profile Page Improvement  
**File:** `lib/core/features/Agrobloc/presentations/pagesAcheteurs/profilPage.dart`
- Restored direct display of `profilId` value:
  - Shows the actual `profilId` value if available
  - Shows "Profil non défini" if `profilId` is null or empty

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred because:
1. The API response might not include a proper `profil_id` field
2. The `AuthentificationModel.fromJson()` method sets empty string as default for missing `profil_id`
3. The profile page was showing "Profil non défini" for any empty `profilId`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test buyer login to ensure profile type displays correctly
2. Verify that the warning message appears in logs if `profilId` is empty
3. Check that users are prompted to complete their profile when needed

## Next Steps
- Monitor logs for any "profilId est vide" warnings to identify users with incomplete profiles
- Consider adding backend validation to ensure `profil_id` is always properly set during registration/login
- Implement a profile completion flow for users with empty `profilId`

## Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/core/features/Agrobloc/data/dataSources/userService.dart`
- ✅ `lib/core/features/Agrobloc/presentations/pagesAcheteurs/profilPage.dart`

The fix provides better user experience by giving clear guidance instead of just showing "undefined profile".
