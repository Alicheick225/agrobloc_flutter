# Syntax Fix Plan for detailOffreVente.dart

## Information Gathered:
- The file has multiple syntax errors including unmatched braces, misplaced return statements, incorrect widget construction, and improper use of const.
- Key issues:
  - Misplaced `return` in `showDialog` callback
  - Incorrect `AlertDialog` structure (using `child` instead of `content`)
  - `style` and `child` properties outside `OutlinedButton` constructor
  - Class marked as `const` with non-final fields
  - Missing `const` in some widget constructors

## Plan:
1. Fix the `showDialog` call by removing the misplaced `return` and correcting `AlertDialog` to use `content` instead of `child`.
2. Move `style` and `child` properties inside the `OutlinedButton` constructor.
3. Remove `const` from the class constructor since fields are not final.
4. Add `const` to appropriate widget constructors like `Text` and `EdgeInsets`.
5. Ensure all braces and parentheses are properly matched.

## Dependent Files:
- None (only this file needs editing)

## Followup Steps:
- Run `flutter run` to verify the build succeeds
- Test the dialog functionality if needed
