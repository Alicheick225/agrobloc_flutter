# TODO: Performance Optimization for Frame Drops and Rendering Issues

## Tasks
- [x] Optimize UserService logging to reduce overhead
- [x] Replace SingleChildScrollView with ListView.builder in HomeProducteur for efficient list rendering
- [ ] Ensure all SharedPreferences operations are batched and non-blocking
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for async operations
- [ ] Test the optimizations by running flutter run and checking for reduced frame drops

## Followup
- [ ] Monitor app performance after changes
- [ ] Address any remaining rendering warnings if possible
